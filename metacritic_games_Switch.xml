After accompanying him to the Dead King's Gate and letting him enter on his own as advised... Well let's just say things go different from there than the Village Elders expected.

In order to reach the Dead King's crypt to save your brother from being sacrificed you'll need to solve puzzles, evade traps and fight a bunch of enemies. There are scrolls to decipher, levers to pull, floor plates to step on, fireballs to evade, doors to smash or to unlock, and a whole lot of enemies to kill. But while Zombies or Dread Beetles are easy prey, a lot of other creatures from Ogres to Dark Elves, Minotaurs and Dragons will require more than just brute force to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;12 May 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;84&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">708398b5d991476325ed76429d0b6c60</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/3d6c4675e8eeb7c6ee821f3bedfafe32-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</title><link>https://metacritic.com/game/switch/zombie-army-4-dead-war/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/f06704c8cb6560710c6cf4821a8a5914-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resistance have defeated Zombie Hitler and cast him into Hell but the dead rise once again with greater hunger than before.

CHARACTERS:&#13;
&#13;
JURO KURABE&#13;
A mild-mannered young high school student trying to live a normal life in the 80s. Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends...&#13;
&#13;
IORI FUYUSAKA&#13;
She believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? &#13;
&#13;
EI SEKIGAHARA &#13;
A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past.

Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... &#13;
&#13;
KEITARO MIURA &#13;
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a "Sentinel", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... &#13;
&#13;
MEGUMI YAKUSHIJI&#13;
A shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side. While she's devoted to her beloved, Juro, he himself has lost all memory of their past relationship.

&#13;
NATSUNO MINAMI &#13;
A perky, friendly girl on her high school's track team who loves a good Sci-Fi story. When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. &#13;
&#13;
NENJI OGATA&#13;
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug. &#13;
&#13;
RENYA GOUTO&#13;
A cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done. &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
SHU AMIGUCHI &#13;
An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt. Tries not to take life too seriously, whether it's on his side or not. But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can. &#13;
&#13;
TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMA&#13;
A confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar.

&#13;
TOMI KISARAGI&#13;
A flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her...&#13;
&#13;
YUKI TAKAMIYA &#13;
A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend.

■2 types of panels for everyone to enjoy synthesis!&#13;
This game uses panel synthesis, the synthesis system of the Mysterious series, where materials are placed in the panel slots to create new items in this puzzle-like feature. By placing the certain materials in the slots, various effects can be produced.&#13;
There are 2 types of panels in this game that players can select from : a regular panel and a restricted panel that has a higher synthesis difficulty level.&#13;
The board of the restricted panel is fairly complex, but when materials are placed just right, items with high effects can be synthesized, which can't be generated from the regular panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;25 February 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;82&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">05b5449a2703b60ba0c1c22f82541623</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/a1c956d16cb8b11f0843a963117da1c0-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Infernax</title><link>https://metacritic.com/game/switch/infernax/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/11cb4c3d2f7f1418752d5a5de81cbeff-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infernax is the adventures of a great knight who returns to his homeland only to find it plagued with unholy magic.

The Pokémon Legends: Arceus game honors past Pokémon games' core gameplay while infusing new action and RPG elements. You'll need to catch, survey, and research wild Pokémon in a long-gone era of the Sinnoh region to create and complete the region's first Pokédex. &#13;
&#13;
-Catch Pokémon-&#13;
To catch Pokémon in the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, you can observe them to learn their behavior, then carefully sneak up, aim your Poké Ball, and let fly!&#13;
&#13;
You can also have your ally Pokémon battle wild Pokémon that you hope to catch. Just throw the Poké Ball holding your ally Pokémon near a wild Pokémon, and you'll seamlessly enter battle and command your Pokémon by choosing from moves it knows.&#13;
&#13;
-An Adventure in the Sinnoh of Days Gone By-&#13;
You'll be brought to the Sinnoh region, the setting for the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. But this story unfolds in a long-gone era, before ideas such as being a Pokémon Trainer or having a Pokémon League even existed.&#13;
&#13;
All around, you'll find Pokémon living wild in harsh environments that make for a Sinnoh unlike the region you may remember from the days of the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games.&#13;
&#13;
The Poké Balls of old were apparently built a little differently from the ones we know so well. They were made mostly of wood, and steam puffed from their tops when Pokémon were caught. &#13;
&#13;
-Meet Your First Partner Pokémon-&#13;
As you start off on your adventure to create the region's first Pokédex, you'll be able to choose Rowlet, Cyndaquil, or Oshawott as a partner.&#13;
&#13;
These three Pokémon arrived with a Pokémon Professor, who encountered them on research excursions to various regions. &#13;
&#13;
Rowlet&#13;

Type: Grass/Flying&#13;
Height: 1'&#13;
Weight: 3.3 lbs.&#13;
&#13;
Rowlet is a Pokémon from the Alola region. It uses photosynthesis to store up energy during the day, while becoming active at night. Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks.&#13;
&#13;
Cyndaquil&#13;
Category: Fire Mouse Pokémon &#13;
Type: Fire&#13;
Height: 1'8"&#13;
Weight: 17.4 lbs.&#13;
&#13;
Cyndaquil is a Pokémon from the Johto region. It is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. When it's surprised, the flames on its back flare up stronger. When it is attacked, it uses its flames to protect itself.&#13;
&#13;
Oshawott&#13;
Category: Sea Otter Pokémon&#13;
Type: Water&#13;
Height: 1'8"&#13;
Weight: 13 lbs.&#13;
&#13;
Oshawott is a Pokémon from the Unova region. With the scalchop on its stomach, it blocks opponents' attacks, then retaliates immediately by slashing. Its scalchop can be used to break open hard Berries as well.&#13;
&#13;
Arceus&#13;
Holding the key to this tale is the Pokémon known as Arceus. Arceus is said to have shaped all there is in this world. Just how is this mighty Pokémon connected to your journey?&#13;
&#13;
Category: Alpha Pokémon&#13;
