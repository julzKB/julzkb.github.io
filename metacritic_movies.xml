Inspired by this myth, Faya Dayi is a spiritual journey into the highlands of Harar immersed in the rituals of khat, a leaf that Sufi Muslims chewed for religious meditations – and Ethiopia’s most lucrative cash crop today. Through the prism of the khat trade, Faya Dayi weaves a tapestry of intimate stories of people caught between violent government repression, khat-induced fantasies and treacherous journeys beyond their borders, and offers a window into the dreams of the youth who long for a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;30 August 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e7b3993ce9e3c886c7ef34f8d890ad5a</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/5/31457ed8ad87aa54693d6dccbf607055-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Nitram</title><link>https://metacritic.com/movie/nitram/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/1/e53d6ede69fc62f98aaa2a3f866cb9e2-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitram (Caleb Landry Jones) lives with his mother (Judy Davis) and father (Anthony LaPaglia) in suburban Australia in the Mid 1990s.

Yet throughout his history-altering political career, he was often treated by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies like an enemy of the state. In this virtuosic documentary, award-winning editor and director Sam Pollard (Editor, 4 LITTLE GIRLS, MO’ BETTER BLUES; Director/Producer, EYEZ ON THE PRIZE, SAMMY DAVIS, JR.: I’VE GOTTA BE ME) lays out a detailed account of the FBI surveillance that dogged King’s activism throughout the ’50s and ’60s, fueled by the racist and red-baiting paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover. In crafting a rich archival tapestry, featuring some revelatory restored footage of King, Pollard urges us to remember that true American progress is always hard-won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;11 January 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">70868d0dca70ad94243fbd8cd217dfed</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/4/c0a0b77e7c3c5bf91a3d2370c9106396-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Mass</title><link>https://metacritic.com/movie/mass/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/3/40b2164c3c5964c975697d41cec73e5d-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years after an unspeakable tragedy tore their lives apart, two sets of parents (Reed Birney and Ann Dowd, Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton), agree to talk privately in an attempt to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;11 January 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">284cc4aed3d4197115f748dab0313ca9</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/3/40b2164c3c5964c975697d41cec73e5d-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>One Night in Miami</title><link>https://metacritic.com/movie/one-night-in-miami/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/8/8b6c2ba8a7a20529b75daedc4722c377-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one incredible night in 1964, four icons of sports, music, and activism gathered to celebrate one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.

They're guided by a secret culture and training passed down through generations, as well as by the noses of their cherished and expertly-trained dogs. They live a simpler, slower way of life, in harmony with their loyal animals and their picture-perfect land, seemingly straight out of a fairy tale. They're untethered to cell phone screens or the Internet, opting instead to make their food and drink by hand and prioritizing in-person connections and community. &#13;
The demand for white truffles increases year after year, even as the supply decreases.

An only child, she has enjoyed a loving relationship with her adoptive parents. However, for as long as Rose can remember she has wanted to know who her biological parents are and the facts of her true identity. After years trying to trace her birth mother, Rose now has a name and a number. All she has to do is pick up the phone and call. When she does it quickly becomes clear that her birth mother has no wish to have any contact. Rose is shattered. A renewed and deepened sense of rejection compels her to keep going. Rose travels from Dublin to London in an effort to confront her birth mother, Ellen (Orla Brady).  Ellen is deeply disturbed when Rose turns up unannounced. The very existence of this young woman threatens the stability of the new life Ellen has painstakingly put together. But Rose proves very tenacious and Ellen is forced to reveal a secret she has kept hidden for over 20 years. This shocking revelation forces Rose to accept the violent nature of how she came into existence.  Rose believes she has little to lose but much to gain when she sets out to confront her biological father, Peter (Aidan Gillen). What Rose cannot possibly foresee is that she is on a collision course that will prove both violent and unsettling – dark forces gather and threaten to destroy her already fragile sense of her own identity.

As New York City became the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Wojnarowicz weaponized his work and waged war against the establishment’s indifference to the plague until his death from it in 1992 at the age of 37. Exclusive access to his breathtaking body of work – including paintings, journals, and films – reveals how Wojnarowicz emptied his life into his art and activism. Rediscovered answering machine tape recordings and intimate recollections from Fran Lebowitz, Gracie Mansion, Peter Hujar, and other friends and family help present a stirring portrait of this fiercely political, unapologetically queer artist.

This documentary chronicles the meteoric rise of a band born of the LA punk scene that not only captured but created a zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;05 February 2021&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">75e8acb8d9d51528b1e2b00bf5ba27ea</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/7/6b7a31c8bf62f882d4dbe6d6894417a5-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>17 Blocks</title><link>https://metacritic.com//movie/17-blocks/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/9/2e45aa33c77fe9389e4b9245b45474f4-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footage from two decades of intimate home video is used to tell the story of the Sanford family, who live just 17 blocks from the U.S. Capitol and whose struggles with addiction and gun violence lead them through a journey of love, loss, and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;19 February 2021&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">65a43d92842a3350817cd97aa64ff835</guid><enclosure url="https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/9/2e45aa33c77fe9389e4b9245b45474f4-98.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Collective</title><link>https://metacritic.com//movie/collective/critic-reviews</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/4/b7d4c9083c9f7f2f52cd076238430158-98.jpg'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collective follows a heroic team of journalists as they uncover shocking, widespread corruption.
